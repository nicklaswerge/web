The main research question is to set the foundations of fast adaptation in continual learning.
His hypothesis is that this problem can be solved by capturing information-rich invariant representations
using tools of causal inference and intervening into the environment to maximize information gain. His
project will address three fundamental questions: 

 * Which exact mechanisms should be used to capture
invariance? 
 * How can optimal interventions be planned? 
 * How can it be theoretically guaranteed that the eventual feedback loop constructs a virtuous cycle?

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:
